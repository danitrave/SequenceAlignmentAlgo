# SequenceAlignmentAlgo
This folder contains a possible implementation of the Needleman &amp; Wunsch and Smith &amp; Waterman algorithms
The following folder contains the implementation of two algorithms to perform sequence alignment of two sequences:
-the Needleman & Wunsch algorithm for global alignment
-the Smith & Waterman algorithm for local alignment
The two sequences must be provided as input
The explanation of the execution of each script is localised at the beginning of each file  as commented lines.
